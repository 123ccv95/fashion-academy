In this chapter we are going to show the basics of caring, what techniques there are. How to choose the best technique, some examples and in the video we will repair a few things.


CARE
Why is maintaining your wardrobe so underestimated if we are talking about sustainability and why is there a lack of education on this level?
Taking care of your clothing was as far as we know in Europe a thing you learned as a woman on the housekeeping school. Around the 90’s and 00’s the rise of ecommerce drove mass-consumption. Lessons in garment care was not required anymore, cause people easily could replace there broken garments by newly made garments that was on trend. People that repaired their clothes still, had the look of a poor man that didn't have money for a new one. Now everyone can wear new clothing and our way of interacting with our clothing became different. We barely don’t have these stories anymore that you still wearing your dad’s old suede lammy coat from your his hippy period. We threw them all out cause it was and is still easier to replace them than to maintain them.

But seeing what this does to our environment and how banal our society gets, cause everyone can have the same shirt, real or fake. For us there is than only a way to educate people again on these topics, next to that support report and activist groups that are already busy with this, introduce circulair systems and support new technologies.  With education we mean how to take care of your clothes again, how to revalue them, make memories with them by repairing and swap them out with friends or family when your tired of it.
Extending the life of clothes by just nine extra months of active use would reduce carbon, water and waste footprints around 20-30% each, cause you avoid production in a short run.
However, no matter how much we value our clothing; clothes that last longer reduce production and processing impacts, but only if new purchases are avoided.
Although garment care accounts for approximately 75-80% of the carbon footprint of any individual piece of clothing. This is because you typically own a garment for longer than the supply chain that created it (hopefully).
So clothing care has an impact too, and yet, there are easy ways to drastically reduce this impact. It starts for sure with the clothing choices you made from the beginning by being aware of the fabric and how it’s produced. We give you some tips underneath this video on what fabrics you can better choose and what certification labels you should know before you buy something new, cause not every label that says is green is green.
But now you bought this garment and what now, how do you actually use this?



Let start by one; get some coffee cause her is some important information coming up;

Know the washing labels
The washing labels are simple icons that give you straight guidelines how to treat and wash your garment. There are only 5 main icons; wash, bleach, tumble dry, iron and dry clean, but these very on what to do with them. The icons are very well explained by The American Cleaning Institute; https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/sites/default/files/assets/1/Page/FabricCareSymbols.pdf
Not only this pdf is very helpful if you want to dive deeper in their research and guidelines on washing check out their website.

Know how the fabric and its qualities behave and how to wash them
Main fabric qualities are based in 3 fiber segments:
(Plant-based) Cellulose Fibers; Cotton, Linen, Viscose, Bamboo, Hemp, Jute, Rayon/Viscose (plantbased, but a man made fiber)
(Animal-based)Protein Fibers;  Wool, Alpaca, Angora, Silk, Cashmere, Mohair, Feathers, Leather
(Oil based) Synthetic Fibers; Nylon, Polyester, Acrylic, Spandex, Neoprene, Synthetic Fleece, Fake fur, leather and suede and other branded synthetic fibers like Lycra.

We can discuss every fiber ( based of the fabric/textile) apart from each other, but most of the time every group has their collective main qualities on how you should treat them in the laundry or after.
Starting with (Plant-based) Cellulose Fibers; Mostly cotton and colored wash you can wash on any temperature. When we talk about underwear and towels which are mainly cotton, wash them on a higher temperature apart from clothes. 100% Cotton, Linen and Viscose can shrink as much as wool, for sure if you talk about the organic Cotton, Linen, Bamboo and Hemp. Give them a wash with a low temperature, preferably with a greasy soap, like green soap.
If we are talking about 100% cotton jeans, you ideally don’t want to wash them. Because of the twill weave jeans/workwear are recognised by, it makes it a strong workable fabric, but by time it also adjust itself to your body. By washing them it loses that fit and if there is elastane (mostly in skinny jeans) it also loses its durability. One way is to clean jeans/workwear isssss putting it in your freezer in a plastic bag for two day. This kills the bacteria and it’s odor, stains can be spot cleaned.

(Animal-based)Protein Fibers;  
Silks are prone to discoloration and should be cleaned after every wear. If you clean them it needs some lukewarm water and needs to be ironed from the inside or hung out wet outside. To keep the softness of silk you can wash it with a little bit of vinegar with some orange peels, to get rid of the vinegar odor.

Leather is like a plant and you need to give it some food with grease. Use old underwear as your grease cloth and rub it in with a circle movement. This counts for jackets and shoes. If it loses its color, you can buy colored grease. Suede can be cleaned with leftover old bread and rub it on, do it outside cause it can cause some dirty floors.

The best way to wash quality wool, would be to spot clean it and let the knit take air, instead of washing it each time. Wool, mohair or alpaca have a high shrinkage level when getting wet. Every now and then, when it actually needs a good wash, we highly recommend to hand-wash it only, and using cold water (not warm) with a soft shampoo. Do not rub it, gently soak it in the cold water mixed with wool detergent for a few minutes (5 to 10 minutes should be okay) and rinse it also gently a couple of times. After, just press the water out of the knit as much as possible (without wringing or squeezing it). The thing with wet Wool is that it tends to stretch easily, this is why you don't want to squeeze it tight or hang it, it's always better to let it air dry by laying it out flat, so it doesn’t grow and deforms it shape.
Absorb excess water to roll up a towel with the sweater laid down inside of it, so that the water is getting absorbed by the towel and leave to dry flat on a drying rack.

De-pilling sweaters (knits); Every protein fiber can pill, this mostly happens by wearing or if you wash in your washing machine; if you do wash them in the washing machine, wash them in side out, to prevent pilling. If you need to depill sweaters there are wool/cashmere brushes for it. You have them in different varieties and prices.
With Mohair you mainly want the opposite because of its fluffiness, that's when you use a mohair comb. We also have electric depillers this is a moving knife that rotates fast and depills the fabric. Most budget version is a razor without a soap block, but that might cause damage. I use the razor in combination with the electric depiller for acrylic sweaters which pills are harders to remove. That leads us to the synthetic fibers.

(Oil based) Synthetic Fibers
Same with synthetic fibers you shouldn’t wash it too high. Know that synthetic is actually plastic and can melt. It also leaves more microfibers with washing, so also with this wash only when needed.
Fleece is known for it’s most releasing microfibers. If you have a sweater or pants from fleece turn it inside down and ideally put it a Guppy bag, that holds most of the microfibers.
For all Synthetic Fibres mainly count in 40 degrees washing with a mild washing detergent, but mainly check the washing label in the side seam of the garment, cause there are a lot of different kinds of compositions out there.  
With swimwear or rash guard clothing always immediately wash them out after use  with lukewarm water and biodegradable soap.
 Arrange your laundry on color
Next to following the guidelines based on fibers, it’s good to sort your washing on fiber. There's more to the sorting game than just keeping dark garments away from the gleaming whites. The secret is mixing and matching items into loads that need similar soaps or detergents, wash cycles and water temperatures. It's the time to check those garment care labels for special cleaning instructions. Without a doubt, smart sorting is the way of insuring clean results - wash, after wash, after wash.

Wash all whites separately. Pastels and medium colors together, but then I will still do towels, underwear and sheets together apart from pastel and medium colored clothing. Brights and darks by themselves. Pay special attention to white and lightly colored synthetics; they can pick up dark dyes from other fabrics during washing. Check trimmings and decorations for colorfastness too.
Also if it's a natural dye we recommend hand washing, with no wring or lower the temperature of your washing machine.
Before you start your laundry always check...
-Pockets; You don’t want any ‘to do list paper pulp’ on your clothes and remove it after an hour. Or a screw in your pocket that rips your pocket. (This sounds like this has happened to me before) So empty pockets before you wash them.

- Zippers and buttons; If you don’t close zippers they might rip other garments or make little holes in fragile fabrics. Open all buttons and hooks to prevent them from ripping off the fabric.
- Washing detergent; Don’t put washing detergents with bleach in colored or black  laundry, it fades the color out (make sense). Put washing powder not straight with the washing, put powder always in the detergent drawer. The powder will leave stains cause it can dissolve entirely with a full wash. Washing liquid can go straight into the washing machine in a bulb. Also there is a world out there of washing detergents for colored, black, whites, wool, softeners…… endless. Next to using the right washing detergent for the right wash, make sure there are no heavy chemicals in the washing detergent. Most simple is making your own, cause you know what is in there, if you want to know more about this check the article underneath.
Pretreat your stains, ideally straight away after

Take care of it as soon as you can. Identify the spot and check what is necessary to remove it, never rub, always bolt/dab it. Ideally try to take a chance to remove it immediately with something that helps to get out the stain. When in doubt, rinse or soak in hot water before treating or laundering, if that doesn’t work try pure alcohol. At the end wash the garment at the highest temperature that's on the washing label. Get into the habit of checking freshly washed wet clothes for stains that don't wash away. Instead of drying them, pretreat the stains and wash them again till the stain is out. Drying can permanently set the stains.



We took the main stains that are very common to me to happen;
-Grease; Rainwater with ⅛ ammonia helps.
-Sweat;  Let it soak in baking soda for a few hours
-Coffee; Let is soak in ¼ glycerine with hot water  
-Ballpoint; Put a lot of toothpaste on the stain and leave it for a while. You will see that the toothpaste will get blue, you can then pour it off with some hot water. Ink works better with salt.
-Oil/butter: Treat immediately with hot water
-Toothpaste; Annoying cause in black clothes it looks like they faded away when wet, but dried up again it’s still there. Just use quite some hot water and it’s gone.
- Chocolate/Cacao: Treat with cold water and ox goal soap or leave it with baking soda.
- Fluor/powder; Just dust it off, otherwise hot water
- Glue; Hot water with vinegar
- Curry: Let is soak in ¼ glycerine with hot water  
- Wine; Salt will absorb everything. pour the salt immediately on the stain. Beverages containing sugar, such as wine or ginger ale, may seem to disappear. But don't be fooled - they may still be there! Once the stain has been exposed to air, the sugar oxidizes and leaves an invisible stain, which ultimately turns yellow or brown. The stain never left .. it was there all along. To remedy? Treat even those light stains you can't see immediately - before they dry.
- Berry/fruit stain; try to leave it for a few hours in milk or pour some salt on the salt on the stain and let it rest for a while. The salt will absorb the stain.
-Mud; Let it dry and than brush/scrub it of with water and salt.
I will say most what I use is ammonia ( only for heavy stains),salt, baking soda, ox gall soap (savon a la bille de boeuf), vinegar and Glycerine
- Paint; New ones can be treated with terpentine, old ones let it soak in a greasy soap; like green soap.

Wash less frequently and wash around 30 degrees.
Try to wash your clothes as less frequently as possible, so not after every wear. The more you wash them, the more they lose their quality. Wash your main clothes around 30 degrees, not only it takes less energy as mentioned before,  it is also for the fibres of the fabric that doesn’t like heat that much. Turning down the temperature keeps the shape of the garment , it keeps most of it’s original dye and it doesn’t shrink or wrinkle that much. Also according to Fashion Revolution reducing your washing temperature and by line-drying your clothes, you reduce your own own carbon footprint by 700.000 tonnes of CO2 a year.

- Use fragrance free, phosphate free, and biodegrading soaps to eliminate endocrine disruptors in our environment (which are correlated to autoimmune, cancer and metabolic disorders). Eliminate fabric softeners all together, and instead use a ½ cup of white vinegar during the rinse cycle.

Avoid Ironing and avoid the dryer.
Preferably don’t use an iron, only when it’s needed and you need to leave in 5 minutes.
When you iron, you’re using heat to loosen fabric fibers and press them flat. The fibres in the fabric only doesn’t like this pressing that much and unfortunately, there’s also a good chance you can end up burning or yellowing the fabric if you’re not doing it properly. Using too much heat on delicate fabrics can completely ruin them or melt them, so make sure you always use the right heat level for the type of fabric you’re ironing and to be precautious always iron from the inside.
Many irons have different levels for various fabrics on the heat dial, but here’s a general guide:

- Linen: 445° F / 229.4℃
- Cotton: 400° F / 204.4℃
- Viscose/Rayon: 375° F / 190.5℃
- Wool: 300° F / 148.88℃
- Acrylic: 275° F / 135℃
- Polyester: 300° F / 148.9℃
- Silk: 300° F / 148.9℃
- Acetate: 290° F / 143.3℃
- Lycra: 275° F / 135℃
- Nylon: 275° F/135℃

I prefer is a iron with a proper steam function, sometimes the steam function  is enough to
get the wrinkles out so you don’t need to press the fibers. If you don’t have time to iron or you don’t have one, steam your clothes by hanging them in the bathroom when you take a hot shower or wet on a hanger and hang them outside (not for knits, see step 2.)

Researchers found that repeatedly drying cotton garments led to cracks in the clothing, which reduced fabric strength by 25 percent or more and also caused pilling
By swapping to air drying you save a lot of time, money, quality and most of all energy & curb emmisions. Use UV light to air and clean smells from protein fibers.
Wool, alpaca, cashmere, mohair and angora do not readily absorb body odor and need little washing, but when they do begin to accumulate odors you can put garments into direct sunlight for several hours. UV light is a practical tradition for cleaning clothing items that dates back as long as humans have worn these fibers.
Don’t do this with natural dyes, cause UV light will change the color.
